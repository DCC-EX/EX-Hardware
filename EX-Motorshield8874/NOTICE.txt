The EX-Motorshield8874 is licenced under CERN-OHL-W. This licence does not grant the right to use any trademarks held by DCC-EX or semify, including logos.
The usage of the logos of DCC-EX and semify on a produced PCB is permitted under the following conditions:
(1) The production must be non-commercial.
(2) The licencee may not produce more than 10 Shields or derived products per year. Any larger production runs may be considered commercial.
(3) The licencee may not make any changes to the source files. This explicitly also forbids the licencee from adding any additional logos or strings.

In any other cases please contact the DCC-EX team regarding a licence for the DCC-EX logo, and/or service@semify-eda.com for usage of the semify logo.

The DCC-EX logo may be removed from the silkscreen at any time. In this case a reference to the location of the source files maintained by DCC-EX must be placed on the PCB (e.g. "github.com/DCC-EX/EX-Hardware/tree/main/EX-MotorShield_8874")

The semify logo may be removed from the silkscreen at any time.

The string "RoHS" must be removed if any parts or processes that are not RoHS-certified are used. This explicitly includes the use of lead solder.

Removing a logo, or updating BOM entries with functionally similar replacement components (including different connector types) exemtps the licencee from having to disclose the modified source files under the CERN-OHL-W licence, if and only if these are the only modifications made.
